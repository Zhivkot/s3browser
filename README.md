# S3Browser

The S3Browser is a simple wrapper around Amazon's [S3 Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
Apart from listing files and managing, S3 doesn't give you a lot of functionality.

This wrapper gives you two killer functions:

* [x] Search
* [ ] Sorting

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 's3browser'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install s3browser

## Usage

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
